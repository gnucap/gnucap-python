This package contains a python plugin for the circuit simulator Gnucap which\    allows the user to write custom commands in Python. 
It also provides a gnucap extension for Python where gnucap can be used 
as a library. No gnucap binary is needed. 

There is also waveform numpy array
conversion functions which means that post-processing of gnucap simulation
results can be done in Python using numpy/scipy/matplotlib.

 Requirements
-------------

You have to installed the modified version of gnucap that is compiled as a
shared library. You can download it from the git repo at 
http://github.com/henjo/gnucap.

Other requirements are:
  * Python >= 2.4
  * Swig
  * Numpy (with development headers/libraries)

 Installation
-------------

Build python plugin for gnucap

.. code-block:: sh
   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ make install

The resulting plugin will be written to "gnucap-plugins/python.so".

Build gnucap extension

.. code-block:: sh
   $ python setup.py build
   $ sudo python setup.py install

Examples
--------

From gnucap
~~~~~~~~~~~

Start a gnucap session, load the python plugin and run the python script test.py. This scripts defines a new command called myplot that plots a stored waveform
using Matplotlib and then runs an ac simulation and plots the result.

.. code-block:: sh
   $ cd examples
   $ gnucap
   gnucap> attach ../gnucap-plugins/python.so
   gnucap> python test.py

From Python
~~~~~~~~~~~

Do the same directly from Python

.. code-block:: sh
   $ cd examples
   $ python test.py
