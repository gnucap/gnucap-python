This is a preliminary python plugin for gnucap that currently can start a IPython shell from within python.

Requirements
------------

You have to installed the modified version of gnucap that is compiled as a
shared library. You can download it from the git repo at 
http://github.com/henjo/gnucap.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: sh
   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ make install

Example
-------

Go to example and run rungnucap.sh as:

.. code-block:: sh
   $ cd examples
   $ sh rungnucap.sh

Then gnucap is started and if everything was compiled correctly an IPython prompy will appear.

Now run:

.. code-block:: python
   >>> import gnucap
   >>> gnucap.command("get eq2-145.ckt")
   >>> gnucap.command("dc")
