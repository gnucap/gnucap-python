This package contains a python plugin for the circuit simulator Gnucap which
allows the user to write custom commands in Python.  It also provides a gnucap
extension for Python where gnucap can be used as a library. No gnucap binary
is needed.

There is also waveform numpy array
conversion functions which means that post-processing of gnucap simulation
results can be done in Python using numpy/scipy/matplotlib.

(this is currently experimental)

 Requirements
-------------

requirements are:
  * gnucap >= oct '17
  * Python >= 2.4
  * Swig
  * Numpy (with development headers/libraries)

 Installation
-------------

Build python plugin for gnucap

::

   $ ./bootstrap
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make install # optional. may require root privileges

will install the python module "gnucap" and a gnucap plugin "python".

Examples
--------

From gnucap
~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   $ gnucap -a python.so
   gnucap> python example/loadplot.py        <= this file is missing, but still.
   gnucap> get example/eq2-145.ckt
   gnucap> store ac vm(2)
   gnucap> ac oct 10 1k 100k
   gnucap> myplot vm(2)

First the gnucap plugin is loaded. The second line loads a new command called 
"myplot" that plots a stored waveform using matplotlib. Line 3-5 loads a 
circuit and runs an ac analysis. Finally the ac magnitude of node 2 is plotted
using the new plotting command.

From Python
~~~~~~~~~~~

Do the same directly from Python

::

   $ python
   >>> import gnucap
   [..]
   welcome to gnucap-python
   >>> gnucap.stuff

stuff is not documented yet.
