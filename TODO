todo, easy
- get rid of warnings
- remove stale numpy code
- need to figure out what to do with interactive output
- node_t/NODE access (done?)

later
- OUTPUT support

hacks
- cleanup does not work in pyton2.
- clone (when implemented in python) must keep a local reference, to trick garbage collector

bugs
- takes ages to compile
- error messages in loadpy...
