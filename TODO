todo, easy
- get rid of warnings
- redirect output to numpy array (from where?)
- need to figure out what to do with interactive output
- python 2 vs 3?
- node_t/NODE access

later
- OUTPUT support

hacks
- clone (when implemented in python) must keep a local reference, to trick garbage collector
- need to be careful with dispatcher instances
